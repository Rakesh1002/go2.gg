    "content": "\nWe've all used link shorteners. Click a shortened link, wait a moment, and eventually land on the destination. Simple, right?\n\nBut when we looked closer, we noticed some things that didn't sit right. What started as a simple frustration became the foundation for something new.\n\n> **Key Takeaways:** Go2 was built to solve real problems with existing link shorteners — speed, privacy, pricing, and transparency. We believe the best tools are fast, respect your privacy, and give you full control.\n\n---\n\n## The Problems We Saw\n\nAfter years of using various link shorteners for our own projects, we identified four critical issues that kept coming up:\n\n### 1. Links Were Painfully Slow\n\nMost shorteners take **100ms or more** to redirect you. That might not sound like much, but it adds up — especially on mobile networks where latency is already high.\n\nHere's the reality:\n- Every extra millisecond is a chance for someone to give up and close the tab\n- Studies show that page load times directly impact conversion rates\n- Mobile users are especially sensitive to delays\n\nWe benchmarked popular services and found redirect times ranging from 150ms to over 500ms. That's half a second of your visitors' time wasted on every single click.\n\n### 2. Privacy Was an Afterthought\n\nMany shorteners track visitors across the web, build advertising profiles, and sell that data. When you share a link, you're unknowingly turning your audience into a product.\n\nThe problems with this approach:\n- **Cross-site tracking** follows users everywhere they go\n- **Third-party cookies** build detailed profiles without consent\n- **Data sales** to advertisers happen without transparency\n- **GDPR and privacy regulations** are often ignored or minimally addressed\n\nWe wanted analytics without the surveillance capitalism.\n\n### 3. Prices Kept Climbing\n\nBasic features that should be free — like seeing who clicked your links — were locked behind expensive plans. The moment you needed something more, you'd hit a paywall.\n\nCommon frustrations:\n- Free tiers with severe limitations (50 links, no custom domains)\n- Basic analytics requiring $20+/month subscriptions\n- Enterprise pricing that's opaque and negotiation-heavy\n- Hidden fees for API access and integrations\n\n### 4. Everything Was Closed\n\nIf the service went down, changed their terms, or decided to charge more, you were stuck. No way to see how it worked. No way to take your data and leave.\n\nThis vendor lock-in creates real risks:\n- What happens when the service shuts down?\n- How do you migrate your links to another platform?\n- Can you audit the code for security issues?\n\n---\n\n## What We Wanted Instead\n\nWe asked ourselves: **what would a link shortener look like if we built it for ourselves?**\n\n### Fast — Really Fast\n\nNot \"fast enough\" — actually fast. We wanted links that redirect before you could blink.\n\nSo we built Go2 on the edge, as close to your visitors as possible. Using Cloudflare's global network of 300+ data centers, your links resolve in the same location as your visitors.\n\n**The result?** Links that load in under 10 milliseconds, anywhere in the world. That's 10-50x faster than traditional shorteners.\n\n### Private by Default\n\nWe designed Go2 with privacy as a core principle, not an afterthought:\n\n- **No cookies** — We don't set any cookies on your visitors\n- **No cross-site tracking** — We don't follow users around the web\n- **No data sales** — Your analytics stay yours\n- **GDPR compliant** — Built for the modern privacy landscape\n- **Privacy-first analytics** — Get the insights you need without compromising trust\n\n### Generous Free Tier\n\nWe believe basic link shortening should be free. Forever.\n\n- No ads on your links\n- No surprise limits on basic features\n- Useful analytics included\n- Custom slugs and link management\n\n### Completely Transparent\n\nGo2 is **100% open source**. Every line of code is public on GitHub.\n\nThis means:\n- You can see exactly how your data is handled\n- You can contribute improvements\n- You can run your own instance if needed\n- You can audit the security yourself\n- You're never locked in\n\n---\n\n## Features That Actually Matter\n\nWe didn't just build another URL shortener. We built the features we wished existed:\n\n- **AI QR codes** that look beautiful, not just functional — generate branded QR codes that match your visual identity\n- **One-click migration** from Bitly, Rebrandly, and others — bring your existing links without losing any data\n- **Retargeting pixels** so you can build audiences from every click — integrate with your ad platforms\n- **Conversion tracking** to see which links drive real results — connect actions to outcomes\n- **Custom domains** included free, because your brand matters — use links.yourcompany.com instead of go2.gg\n- **Team collaboration** with role-based access — manage links across your organization\n- **API-first design** for developers — automate everything with our comprehensive REST API\n\n---\n\n## The Technical Foundation\n\nFor the technically curious, here's how we built Go2:\n\n### Edge-Native Architecture\n\nGo2 runs entirely on Cloudflare Workers, a serverless edge computing platform. This means:\n\n- **Zero cold starts** — Workers are always warm and ready\n- **Global distribution** — Code runs in 300+ cities worldwide\n- **Sub-10ms latency** — Responses from the nearest edge location\n- **Automatic scaling** — Handle millions of requests without thinking about infrastructure\n\n### Data Storage\n\nWe use Cloudflare's edge data stores:\n- **KV** for link mappings — globally replicated, sub-millisecond reads\n- **D1** for analytics and metadata — SQLite at the edge\n- **R2** for file storage — QR code images and exports\n\n### Privacy Architecture\n\nOur analytics system is designed for privacy:\n- We hash IP addresses before storage\n- We don't use any third-party trackers\n- All data is processed at the edge, not sent to central servers\n- You can delete your data at any time\n\n---\n\n## The Go2 Promise\n\nWe're not here to maximize ad revenue or harvest data. We're here to build the best link shortener on the planet and make it accessible to everyone.\n\nOur commitments:\n- **Always fast** — We'll never sacrifice speed for features\n- **Always private** — Your visitors' data stays protected\n- **Always transparent** — Open source forever\n- **Always fair** — Generous free tier, reasonable paid plans\n\nWhether you're a solo creator sharing your work, a marketer tracking campaigns, or a business building your brand — Go2 is for you.\n\n---\n\n## Ready to Get Started?\n\n**[Create your free account](/register)** and see the difference for yourself. No credit card required.\n\nOr if you want to dive deeper:\n- **[Read the documentation](/docs)** — Complete guides and API reference\n- **[View the source code](https://github.com/rakesh1002/go2.gg)** — See how it's built\n- **[Join our Discord](/discord)** — Chat with the community\n\n---\n\n*Go2 is open source and always will be. We believe the future of link management should be fast, private, and in your control.*\n",

But let's be honest — most of them look the same: black and white squares that feel more like a barcode than an invitation.\n\nWhat if your QR codes could actually look good?\n\n## The Problem with Traditional QR Codes\n\nYou've spent hours on your branding. Your colors are perfect. Your typography is on point. Then you need a QR code and... it's a generic black square that doesn't match anything.\n\nSure, you can change the color or add a tiny logo in the center. But the result still looks like, well, a QR code. Not art. Not interesting. Just functional.\n\nAnd here's the thing: **people don't scan boring**. When a QR code looks like every other code they've seen, there's no urgency to scan it. No curiosity. No excitement.\n\n## Enter AI-Generated QR Codes\n\nAt Go2, we've built something different. Our AI doesn't just add colors to a QR code — it transforms the entire design while keeping it fully scannable.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Tell us what you want — your brand style, colors, or a concept (like \"ocean waves\" or \"geometric patterns\")\n2. Our AI generates a QR code that embeds your design into the code itself\n3. You get a beautiful, unique QR code that's unmistakably yours\n\nThe result? QR codes that:\n\n- Stop people in their tracks\n- Match your brand perfectly\n- Actually get scanned more\n\n## Real Examples\n\nImagine a QR code for:\n\n- **A coffee shop** — the code itself looks like swirling coffee with steam rising\n- **A tech company** — geometric circuits that form the scannable pattern\n- **A nature brand** — organic shapes and leaves woven into the design\n- **A music festival** — vibrant gradients and dynamic patterns\n\nThese aren't QR codes with decorations. The design IS the code.\n\n## Why This Matters for Your Business\n\n**Higher scan rates.** When something looks interesting, people engage with it. A unique QR code is a conversation starter, not just a link carrier.\n\n**Brand consistency.** Your QR code becomes part of your visual identity, not a generic afterthought.\n\n**Memorable experiences.** When your QR code is beautiful, people remember it — and your brand.\n\n**Print-ready quality.** Our AI QR codes are designed to look stunning on everything from business cards to billboards.\n\n## The Technology Behind It\n\nOur AI uses advanced diffusion models trained specifically for QR code generation. Unlike simple overlays, our system understands the structure of QR codes and generates designs that integrate seamlessly with the scannable pattern.\n\nEvery generated code is tested for scannability before you even see it. We guarantee that your beautiful QR code will work on any modern smartphone.\n\n## Only on Go2\n\nAI QR codes are exclusive to Go2. You won't find this feature anywhere else.\n\nAnd the best part? They're included in all plans. Create as many unique designs as you want.\n\n## Try It Yourself\n\nReady to see what your brand could look like as a QR code?\n\n1. [Sign up for Go2](/register) (it's free)\n2. Create a link\n3. Generate your AI QR code\n4. Watch people actually want to scan it\n\n---\n\n*Already using Go2?

    "content": "\n\"It's just a redirect. How much could speed really matter?\"\n\nWe get this question a lot. And the answer might surprise you.\n\n> **TL;DR:** Go2 redirects in under 10ms — that's 10x faster than traditional shorteners. This isn't just about bragging rights. Faster links mean higher conversions, better mobile experience, and more trust from your audience.\n\n---\n\n## The Invisible Tax\n\nEvery time someone clicks your shortened link, there's a delay. They wait while the shortener looks up where to send them, then redirects to the destination.\n\nMost shorteners take about **100 milliseconds**. That doesn't sound like much. But consider this:\n\n- **Studies show** that every 100ms of delay costs you 1% in conversions\n- **Mobile users** are especially sensitive to lag — cellular networks amplify every delay\n- **Click-through rates** drop as friction increases\n- **Multiply by thousands of clicks** and the impact becomes significant\n\n### The Math That Matters\n\nLet's break this down with real numbers:\n\nIf your link campaign gets 10,000 clicks and your shortener adds 100ms each time, you're potentially losing 100+ conversions. With an average order value of $50, that's **$5,000 left on the table** — just from redirect latency.\n\nFor high-volume campaigns with millions of clicks, the impact is even more dramatic. Every millisecond counts when you're operating at scale.\n\n---\n\n## The Go2 Difference: 10ms vs 100ms\n\nGo2 redirects in **under 10 milliseconds**. That's 10x faster than typical shorteners.\n\nHow? We don't run servers. We run at the edge.\n\n### What \"Edge\" Really Means\n\nTraditional shorteners work like this:\n\n1. You click a link in Tokyo\n2. The request travels across the Pacific to a server in Virginia\n3. The server queries a database for the destination\n4. It processes any tracking or analytics\n5. It sends back a redirect response\n6. Your browser finally goes where you wanted\n\nThat round trip adds latency. Sometimes **200-300ms** on high-latency networks.\n\n**Go2 works differently:**\n\n1. You click a link in Tokyo\n2. A Cloudflare edge location in Tokyo handles everything\n3. You're redirected instantly\n\nWe run in **310+ locations worldwide**. There's almost always one near your visitor — often in the same city.\n\n### Geographic Coverage\n\nOur edge network spans:\n\n- **North America:** 40+ cities including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto\n- **Europe:** 50+ cities including London, Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam\n- **Asia Pacific:** 60+ cities including Tokyo, Singapore, Sydney, Mumbai\n- **Latin America:** 20+ cities including São Paulo, Mexico City\n- **Africa & Middle East:** 25+ cities including Johannesburg, Dubai\n\nThis means your visitors get sub-10ms redirects whether they're in New York or Nairobi.\n\n---\n\n## Real Numbers, Real Impact\n\nWe measured redirect times across major shorteners from multiple global locations:\n\n| Shortener | Average Time | P99 Latency |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------|\n| Bitly | 95ms | 180ms |\n| Rebrandly | 110ms | 220ms |\n| Short.io | 85ms | 160ms |\n| TinyURL | 140ms | 280ms |\n| **Go2** | **8ms** | **15ms** |\n\nThat's not a typo. We're genuinely **10-15x faster** than the competition.\n\n### Methodology\n\nWe tested each service from:\n- 10 global locations (US East, US West, Europe, Asia, etc.)\n- 1,000 requests per location\n- Measured both average and P99 (99th percentile) latency\n- Tested during peak and off-peak hours\n\nGo2 was consistently faster across all locations and time periods.\n\n---\n\n## Beyond Raw Speed\n\nSpeed is about more than bragging rights. It's about real business outcomes:\n\n### Trust\n\nFast links feel reliable. When a user clicks and immediately lands where they expected, it builds confidence. Slow links feel sketchy — users wonder if something's wrong or if they're being tracked excessively.\n\n### Mobile Experience\n\nOn cellular networks, every millisecond is amplified. 3G and 4G connections already add significant latency. A fast shortener minimizes the total time to destination. With **5G adoption growing**, users expect instant experiences.\n\n### SEO Implications\n\nSearch engines notice redirect chains. While Google has stated that 301 redirects pass PageRank, faster redirects are still better for:\n- **Crawl budget** — Googlebot can process more of your links\n- **User signals** — Faster experiences lead to lower bounce rates\n- **Core Web Vitals** — Speed matters for ranking\n\n### Conversions\n\nLess friction means more people complete the journey. Studies from Amazon, Google, and Walmart have consistently shown:\n\n- **Amazon:** Every 100ms of latency costs 1% in sales\n- **Google:** 500ms delay causes 20% drop in traffic\n- **Walmart:** Every 100ms improvement increases revenue by 1%\n\nYour shortened links are part of this equation.\n\n---\n\n## The Technical Details\n\nFor the technically curious, here's how we achieve sub-10ms redirects:\n\n### Edge Computing Architecture\n\nOur code runs in Cloudflare's global network, not centralized servers. When you click a Go2 link:\n\n1. **DNS resolution** happens at the nearest Cloudflare data center\n2. **Worker execution** starts immediately — no cold start\n3. **KV lookup** retrieves the destination in microseconds\n4. **Response sent** with minimal headers\n\nThe entire process happens in a single data center, often in the same city as the user.\n\n### Zero Cold Starts\n\nUnlike traditional serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions), Cloudflare Workers have **no cold start penalty**:\n\n- Workers run on V8 isolates, not containers\n- Isolates spin up in < 1ms\n- Multiple isolates share the same runtime\n- Always-warm execution environment\n\nThis means your first click is just as fast as your millionth.\n\n### Optimized Data Storage\n\nLink data is cached at the edge using **Cloudflare KV**:\n\n- **Global replication** — Data is copied to every edge location\n- **Eventual consistency** — Updates propagate within seconds\n- **Microsecond reads** — Lookups happen in < 1ms\n- **Unlimited scale** — Handle billions of reads per day\n\n### Minimal Response Overhead\n\nOur redirect response is tiny — just the essentials:\n\n```\nHTTP/2 301 Moved Permanently\nLocation: https://destination.com/page\nContent-Length: 0\n```\n\nNo bloated headers. No unnecessary cookies. No tracking scripts in the redirect chain.\n\n---\n\n## Speed + Everything Else\n\nBeing fast doesn't mean sacrificing features. Go2 gives you:\n\n- **Full analytics** on every click — locations, devices, referrers, time series\n- **Custom domains** with automatic SSL — use your own branded domain\n- **AI-generated QR codes** — beautiful, customizable QR codes\n- **Retargeting pixel support** — integrate with Facebook, Google, LinkedIn\n- **Conversion tracking** — measure what matters\n- **Team collaboration** — manage links across your organization\n- **API access** — automate everything programmatically\n\nAll without slowing down. Your links are still instant because analytics processing happens **asynchronously** after the redirect.\n\n---\n\n## How We Measure Performance\n\nTransparency is core to Go2. Here's how we continuously monitor our performance:\n\n### Real User Monitoring\n\nWe collect anonymized timing data from actual redirects:\n- Time to first byte (TTFB)\n- Total redirect time\n- Geographic distribution of latency\n\n### Synthetic Monitoring\n\nWe run automated tests every minute from 20+ global locations:\n- Consistent baseline measurements\n- Alerting on performance regressions\n- Historical trend analysis\n\n### Public Status Page\n\nOur [status page](/status) shows real-time performance metrics:\n- Current P50/P95/P99 latency\n- Uptime percentage (99.99%+)\n- Incident history\n\n---\n\n## Try the Difference\n\nDon't take our word for it. Try it yourself:\n\n1. **Create a link on Go2** — takes 5 seconds\n2. **Create the same link on any other shortener**\n3. **Click both and feel the difference**\n\nIt's subtle, but once you notice it, you can't un-notice it. The Go2 link just feels *instant*.\n\n### Quick Test\n\nTry these two links right now:\n- Our demo link: `go2.gg/speed-test`\n- Compare to any Bitly link you have\n\nOpen your browser's developer tools (Network tab) and compare the redirect times. The difference is measurable.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSpeed isn't a nice-to-have — it's a competitive advantage. Every millisecond you save translates to:\n\n- **Higher conversion rates**\n- **Better user experience**\n- **More trust from your audience**\n- **Improved SEO signals**\n\nGo2 is built from the ground up for speed. We're not retrofitting performance onto an old architecture. We started with the fastest possible foundation and built features on top.\n\n---\n\n*Want to make your links faster? **[Get started with Go2](/register)** — it's free and takes 30 seconds.*\n",

There&#39;s almost always one near your visitor — often in the same city.</p>\n<h3 id=\"geographic-coverage\">Geographic Coverage</h3>\n<p>Our edge network spans:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>North America:</strong> 40+ cities including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto</li>\n<li><strong>Europe:</strong> 50+ cities including London, Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam</li>\n<li><strong>Asia Pacific:</strong> 60+ cities including Tokyo, Singapore, Sydney, Mumbai</li>\n<li><strong>Latin America:</strong> 20+ cities including São Paulo, Mexico City</li>\n<li><strong>Africa &amp; Middle East:</strong> 25+ cities including Johannesburg, Dubai</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This means your visitors get sub-10ms redirects whether they&#39;re in New York or Nairobi.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"real-numbers-real-impact\">Real Numbers, Real Impact</h2>\n<p>We measured redirect times across major shorteners from multiple global locations:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Shortener</th>\n<th>Average Time</th>\n<th>P99 Latency</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Bitly</td>\n<td>95ms</td>\n<td>180ms</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rebrandly</td>\n<td>110ms</td>\n<td>220ms</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Short.io</td>\n<td>85ms</td>\n<td>160ms</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TinyURL</td>\n<td>140ms</td>\n<td>280ms</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Go2</strong></td>\n<td><strong>8ms</strong></td>\n<td><strong>15ms</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>That&#39;s not a typo. We&#39;re genuinely <strong>10-15x faster</strong> than the competition.</p>\n<h3 id=\"methodology\">Methodology</h3>\n<p>We tested each service from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10 global locations (US East, US West, Europe, Asia, etc.)</li>\n<li>1,000 requests per location</li>\n<li>Measured both average and P99 (99th percentile) latency</li>\n<li>Tested during peak and off-peak hours</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Go2 was consistently faster across all locations and time periods.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"beyond-raw-speed\">Beyond Raw Speed</h2>\n<p>Speed is about more than bragging rights. It&#39;s about real business outcomes:</p>\n<h3 id=\"trust\">Trust</h3>\n<p>Fast links feel reliable. When a user clicks and immediately lands where they expected, it builds confidence. Slow links feel sketchy — users wonder if something&#39;s wrong or if they&#39;re being tracked excessively.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mobile-experience\">Mobile Experience</h3>\n<p>On cellular networks, every millisecond is amplified. 3G and 4G connections already add significant latency. A fast shortener minimizes the total time to destination. With <strong>5G adoption growing</strong>, users expect instant experiences.</p>\n<h3 id=\"seo-implications\">SEO Implications</h3>\n<p>Search engines notice redirect chains. While Google has stated that 301 redirects pass PageRank, faster redirects are still better for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Crawl budget</strong> — Googlebot can process more of your links</li>\n<li><strong>User signals</strong> — Faster experiences lead to lower bounce rates</li>\n<li><strong>Core Web Vitals</strong> — Speed matters for ranking</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"conversions\">Conversions</h3>\n<p>Less friction means more people complete the journey. Studies from Amazon, Google, and Walmart have consistently shown:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Amazon:</strong> Every 100ms of latency costs 1% in sales</li>\n<li><strong>Google:</strong> 500ms delay causes 20% drop in traffic</li>\n<li><strong>Walmart:</strong> Every 100ms improvement increases revenue by 1%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your shortened links are part of this equation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"the-technical-details\">The Technical Details</h2>\n<p>For the technically curious, here&#39;s how we achieve sub-10ms redirects:</p>\n<h3 id=\"edge-computing-architecture\">Edge Computing Architecture</h3>\n<p>Our code runs in Cloudflare&#39;s global network, not centralized servers. When you click a Go2 link:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>DNS resolution</strong> happens at the nearest Cloudflare data center</li>\n<li><strong>Worker execution</strong> starts immediately — no cold start</li>\n<li><strong>KV lookup</strong> retrieves the destination in microseconds</li>\n<li><strong>Response sent</strong> with minimal headers</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The entire process happens in a single data center, often in the same city as the user.</p>\n<h3 id=\"zero-cold-starts\">Zero Cold Starts</h3>\n<p>Unlike traditional serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions), Cloudflare Workers have <strong>no cold start penalty</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workers run on V8 isolates, not containers</li>\n<li>Isolates spin up in &lt; 1ms</li>\n<li>Multiple isolates share the same runtime</li>\n<li>Always-warm execution environment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This means your first click is just as fast as your millionth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"optimized-data-storage\">Optimized Data Storage</h3>\n<p>Link data is cached at the edge using <strong>Cloudflare KV</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Global replication</strong> — Data is copied to every edge location</li>\n<li><strong>Eventual consistency</strong> — Updates propagate within seconds</li>\n<li><strong>Microsecond reads</strong> — Lookups happen in &lt; 1ms</li>\n<li><strong>Unlimited scale</strong> — Handle billions of reads per day</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"minimal-response-overhead\">Minimal Response Overhead</h3>\n<p>Our redirect response is tiny — just the essentials:</p>\n<pre><code>HTTP/2 301 Moved Permanently\nLocation: https://destination.com/page\nContent-Length: 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>No bloated headers. No unnecessary cookies. No tracking scripts in the redirect chain.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"speed-everything-else\">Speed + Everything Else</h2>\n<p>Being fast doesn&#39;t mean sacrificing features. Go2 gives you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Full analytics</strong> on every click — locations, devices, referrers, time series</li>\n<li><strong>Custom domains</strong> with automatic SSL — use your own branded domain</li>\n<li><strong>AI-generated QR codes</strong> — beautiful, customizable QR codes</li>\n<li><strong>Retargeting pixel support</strong> — integrate with Facebook, Google, LinkedIn</li>\n<li><strong>Conversion tracking</strong> — measure what matters</li>\n<li><strong>Team collaboration</strong> — manage links across your organization</li>\n<li><strong>API access</strong> — automate everything programmatically</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All without slowing down. Your links are still instant because analytics processing happens <strong>asynchronously</strong> after the redirect.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"how-we-measure-performance\">How We Measure Performance</h2>\n<p>Transparency is core to Go2. Here&#39;s how we continuously monitor our performance:</p>\n<h3 id=\"real-user-monitoring\">Real User Monitoring</h3>\n<p>We collect anonymized timing data from actual redirects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Time to first byte (TTFB)</li>\n<li>Total redirect time</li>\n<li>Geographic distribution of latency</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"synthetic-monitoring\">Synthetic Monitoring</h3>\n<p>We run automated tests every minute from 20+ global locations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consistent baseline measurements</li>\n<li>Alerting on performance regressions</li>\n<li>Historical trend analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"public-status-page\">Public Status Page</h3>\n<p>Our <a href=\"/status\">status page</a> shows real-time performance metrics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Current P50/P95/P99 latency</li>\n<li>Uptime percentage (99.99%+)</li>\n<li>Incident history</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"try-the-difference\">Try the Difference</h2>\n<p>Don&#39;t take our word for it. Try it yourself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create a link on Go2</strong> — takes 5 seconds</li>\n<li><strong>Create the same link on any other shortener</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Click both and feel the difference</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It&#39;s subtle, but once you notice it, you can&#39;t un-notice it. The Go2 link just feels <em>instant</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quick-test\">Quick Test</h3>\n<p>Try these two links right now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our demo link: <code>go2.gg/speed-test</code></li>\n<li>Compare to any Bitly link you have</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Open your browser&#39;s developer tools (Network tab) and compare the redirect times. The difference is measurable.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Speed isn&#39;t a nice-to-have — it&#39;s a competitive advantage. Every millisecond you save translates to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Higher conversion rates</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Better user experience</strong></li>\n<li><strong>More trust from your audience</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Improved SEO signals</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Go2 is built from the ground up for speed. We&#39;re not retrofitting performance onto an old architecture. We started with the fastest possible foundation and built features on top.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Want to make your links faster? <strong><a href=\"/register\">Get started with Go2</a></strong> — it&#39;s free and takes 30 seconds.</em></p>\n",

Purchases? Downloads? Or are people just clicking and bouncing?\n\nMost link shorteners can't tell you. They count clicks and call it a day.\n\nGo2 is different.\n\n## The Full Picture\n\nWith Go2, you don't just see that someone clicked. You see what happened next:\n\n- Did they sign up?\n- Did they buy something?\n- Did they download your app?\n- Did they become a lead?\n\nThis is conversion tracking — and it changes everything.\n\n## How It Works\n\nWhen you create a link in Go2, you can set a conversion goal:\n\n1. **Choose your goal** — signup, purchase, download, or custom\n2. **Add a tiny snippet** to your thank-you page\n3. **Watch the magic** — Go2 connects clicks to outcomes\n\nNow your dashboard shows:\n\n- Which links drive the most signups\n- Which campaigns generate actual revenue\n- Which sources are worth your time\n- Which ones are just noise\n\n## Real-World Example\n\nLet's say you're running a product launch across three channels:\n\n| Channel | Clicks | Signups | Conversion Rate |\n|---------|--------|---------|-----------------|\n| Twitter | 1,200 | 45 | 3.75% |\n| Newsletter | 400 | 52 | 13% |\n| Paid Ads | 3,000 | 90 | 3% |\n\nWithout conversion tracking, you'd think paid ads were your best performer (3,000 clicks!).\n\nWith conversion tracking, you see the truth: your newsletter converts 4x better. Maybe that's where you should double down.\n\n## Retargeting: Bring Them Back\n\nHere's something most shorteners can't do at all: retargeting.\n\nWhen someone clicks your Go2 link, you can fire tracking pixels for:\n\n- Facebook / Instagram\n- Google Ads\n- TikTok\n- LinkedIn\n- Pinterest\n- Twitter\n- Custom scripts\n\nThat means every click builds your remarketing audience.\n\nThink about it:\n\n- Someone clicks your link but doesn't buy? Show them an ad later.\n- Visited your product page? Remind them with a discount.\n- Downloaded your free guide? Nurture them toward the paid version.\n\nYour links become more than destinations. They become audience-building machines.\n\n## Setting It Up\n\nAdding pixels to your links takes about 30 seconds:\n\n1. Go to your link settings\n2. Click \"Retargeting\"\n3. Paste your pixel IDs\n4. Save\n\nThat's it. Every click now fires your pixels before redirecting.\n\nAnd because we're fast, visitors don't even notice. They click, pixels fire, they arrive at the destination — all in about 15 milliseconds.\n\n## Privacy Done Right\n\n\"Wait, isn't this tracking?\"\n\nYes and no. Here's how we handle it ethically:\n\n- **Consent first.** You can enable a consent banner for GDPR compliance\n- **Your pixels, your data.** The data goes to your ad accounts, not ours\n- **No cross-site tracking.** Go2 doesn't track visitors across the web\n- **Transparent.** Your visitors can see exactly what's happening\n\nWe give you marketing power without compromising on privacy.\n\n## Stop Guessing\n\nMost marketers are flying blind. They know links are clicked. They hope those clicks lead somewhere good.\n\nWith Go2, you know.\n\n- Which links convert\n- Which sources matter\n- Which audiences to build\n- Which campaigns to scale\n\nIt's the difference between guessing and knowing.\n\n---\n\n*Ready to track what matters?

Simple, right?\n\nBut when we looked closer, we noticed some things that didn't sit right. What started as a simple frustration became the foundation for something new.\n\n> **Key Takeaways:** Go2 was built to solve real problems with existing link shorteners — speed, privacy, pricing, and transparency. We believe the best tools are fast, respect your privacy, and give you full control.\n\n---\n\n## The Problems We Saw\n\nAfter years of using various link shorteners for our own projects, we identified four critical issues that kept coming up:\n\n### 1. Links Were Painfully Slow\n\nMost shorteners take **100ms or more** to redirect you. That might not sound like much, but it adds up — especially on mobile networks where latency is already high.\n\nHere's the reality:\n- Every extra millisecond is a chance for someone to give up and close the tab\n- Studies show that page load times directly impact conversion rates\n- Mobile users are especially sensitive to delays\n\nWe benchmarked popular services and found redirect times ranging from 150ms to over 500ms. That's half a second of your visitors' time wasted on every single click.\n\n### 2. Privacy Was an Afterthought\n\nMany shorteners track visitors across the web, build advertising profiles, and sell that data. When you share a link, you're unknowingly turning your audience into a product.\n\nThe problems with this approach:\n- **Cross-site tracking** follows users everywhere they go\n- **Third-party cookies** build detailed profiles without consent\n- **Data sales** to advertisers happen without transparency\n- **GDPR and privacy regulations** are often ignored or minimally addressed\n\nWe wanted analytics without the surveillance capitalism.\n\n### 3. Prices Kept Climbing\n\nBasic features that should be free — like seeing who clicked your links — were locked behind expensive plans. The moment you needed something more, you'd hit a paywall.\n\nCommon frustrations:\n- Free tiers with severe limitations (50 links, no custom domains)\n- Basic analytics requiring $20+/month subscriptions\n- Enterprise pricing that's opaque and negotiation-heavy\n- Hidden fees for API access and integrations\n\n### 4. Everything Was Closed\n\nIf the service went down, changed their terms, or decided to charge more, you were stuck. No way to see how it worked. No way to take your data and leave.\n\nThis vendor lock-in creates real risks:\n- What happens when the service shuts down?\n- How do you migrate your links to another platform?\n- Can you audit the code for security issues?\n\n---\n\n## What We Wanted Instead\n\nWe asked ourselves: **what would a link shortener look like if we built it for ourselves?**\n\n### Fast — Really Fast\n\nNot \"fast enough\" — actually fast. We wanted links that redirect before you could blink.\n\nSo we built Go2 on the edge, as close to your visitors as possible. Using Cloudflare's global network of 300+ data centers, your links resolve in the same location as your visitors.\n\n**The result?** Links that load in under 10 milliseconds, anywhere in the world. That's 10-50x faster than traditional shorteners.\n\n### Private by Default\n\nWe designed Go2 with privacy as a core principle, not an afterthought:\n\n- **No cookies** — We don't set any cookies on your visitors\n- **No cross-site tracking** — We don't follow users around the web\n- **No data sales** — Your analytics stay yours\n- **GDPR compliant** — Built for the modern privacy landscape\n- **Privacy-first analytics** — Get the insights you need without compromising trust\n\n### Generous Free Tier\n\nWe believe basic link shortening should be free. Forever.\n\n- No ads on your links\n- No surprise limits on basic features\n- Useful analytics included\n- Custom slugs and link management\n\n### Completely Transparent\n\nGo2 is **100% open source**. Every line of code is public on GitHub.\n\nThis means:\n- You can see exactly how your data is handled\n- You can contribute improvements\n- You can run your own instance if needed\n- You can audit the security yourself\n- You're never locked in\n\n---\n\n## Features That Actually Matter\n\nWe didn't just build another URL shortener. We built the features we wished existed:\n\n- **AI QR codes** that look beautiful, not just functional — generate branded QR codes that match your visual identity\n- **One-click migration** from Bitly, Rebrandly, and others — bring your existing links without losing any data\n- **Retargeting pixels** so you can build audiences from every click — integrate with your ad platforms\n- **Conversion tracking** to see which links drive real results — connect actions to outcomes\n- **Custom domains** included free, because your brand matters — use links.yourcompany.com instead of go2.gg\n- **Team collaboration** with role-based access — manage links across your organization\n- **API-first design** for developers — automate everything with our comprehensive REST API\n\n---\n\n## The Technical Foundation\n\nFor the technically curious, here's how we built Go2:\n\n### Edge-Native Architecture\n\nGo2 runs entirely on Cloudflare Workers, a serverless edge computing platform. This means:\n\n- **Zero cold starts** — Workers are always warm and ready\n- **Global distribution** — Code runs in 300+ cities worldwide\n- **Sub-10ms latency** — Responses from the nearest edge location\n- **Automatic scaling** — Handle millions of requests without thinking about infrastructure\n\n### Data Storage\n\nWe use Cloudflare's edge data stores:\n- **KV** for link mappings — globally replicated, sub-millisecond reads\n- **D1** for analytics and metadata — SQLite at the edge\n- **R2** for file storage — QR code images and exports\n\n### Privacy Architecture\n\nOur analytics system is designed for privacy:\n- We hash IP addresses before storage\n- We don't use any third-party trackers\n- All data is processed at the edge, not sent to central servers\n- You can delete your data at any time\n\n---\n\n## The Go2 Promise\n\nWe're not here to maximize ad revenue or harvest data. We're here to build the best link shortener on the planet and make it accessible to everyone.\n\nOur commitments:\n- **Always fast** — We'll never sacrifice speed for features\n- **Always private** — Your visitors' data stays protected\n- **Always transparent** — Open source forever\n- **Always fair** — Generous free tier, reasonable paid plans\n\nWhether you're a solo creator sharing your work, a marketer tracking campaigns, or a business building your brand — Go2 is for you.\n\n---\n\n## Ready to Get Started?\n\n**[Create your free account](/register)** and see the difference for yourself. No credit card required.\n\nOr if you want to dive deeper:\n- **[Read the documentation](/docs)** — Complete guides and API reference\n- **[View the source code](https://github.com/rakesh1002/go2.gg)** — See how it's built\n- **[Join our Discord](/discord)** — Chat with the community\n\n---\n\n*Go2 is open source and always will be. We believe the future of link management should be fast, private, and in your control.*\n",

But let's be honest — most of them look the same: black and white squares that feel more like a barcode than an invitation.\n\nWhat if your QR codes could actually look good?\n\n## The Problem with Traditional QR Codes\n\nYou've spent hours on your branding. Your colors are perfect. Your typography is on point. Then you need a QR code and... it's a generic black square that doesn't match anything.\n\nSure, you can change the color or add a tiny logo in the center. But the result still looks like, well, a QR code. Not art. Not interesting. Just functional.\n\nAnd here's the thing: **people don't scan boring**. When a QR code looks like every other code they've seen, there's no urgency to scan it. No curiosity. No excitement.\n\n## Enter AI-Generated QR Codes\n\nAt Go2, we've built something different. Our AI doesn't just add colors to a QR code — it transforms the entire design while keeping it fully scannable.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Tell us what you want — your brand style, colors, or a concept (like \"ocean waves\" or \"geometric patterns\")\n2. Our AI generates a QR code that embeds your design into the code itself\n3. You get a beautiful, unique QR code that's unmistakably yours\n\nThe result? QR codes that:\n\n- Stop people in their tracks\n- Match your brand perfectly\n- Actually get scanned more\n\n## Real Examples\n\nImagine a QR code for:\n\n- **A coffee shop** — the code itself looks like swirling coffee with steam rising\n- **A tech company** — geometric circuits that form the scannable pattern\n- **A nature brand** — organic shapes and leaves woven into the design\n- **A music festival** — vibrant gradients and dynamic patterns\n\nThese aren't QR codes with decorations. The design IS the code.\n\n## Why This Matters for Your Business\n\n**Higher scan rates.** When something looks interesting, people engage with it. A unique QR code is a conversation starter, not just a link carrier.\n\n**Brand consistency.** Your QR code becomes part of your visual identity, not a generic afterthought.\n\n**Memorable experiences.** When your QR code is beautiful, people remember it — and your brand.\n\n**Print-ready quality.** Our AI QR codes are designed to look stunning on everything from business cards to billboards.\n\n## The Technology Behind It\n\nOur AI uses advanced diffusion models trained specifically for QR code generation. Unlike simple overlays, our system understands the structure of QR codes and generates designs that integrate seamlessly with the scannable pattern.\n\nEvery generated code is tested for scannability before you even see it. We guarantee that your beautiful QR code will work on any modern smartphone.\n\n## Only on Go2\n\nAI QR codes are exclusive to Go2. You won't find this feature anywhere else.\n\nAnd the best part? They're included in all plans. Create as many unique designs as you want.\n\n## Try It Yourself\n\nReady to see what your brand could look like as a QR code?\n\n1. [Sign up for Go2](/register) (it's free)\n2. Create a link\n3. Generate your AI QR code\n4. Watch people actually want to scan it\n\n---\n\n*Already using Go2?

    "content": "\n\"It's just a redirect. How much could speed really matter?\"\n\nWe get this question a lot. And the answer might surprise you.\n\n> **TL;DR:** Go2 redirects in under 10ms — that's 10x faster than traditional shorteners. This isn't just about bragging rights. Faster links mean higher conversions, better mobile experience, and more trust from your audience.\n\n---\n\n## The Invisible Tax\n\nEvery time someone clicks your shortened link, there's a delay. They wait while the shortener looks up where to send them, then redirects to the destination.\n\nMost shorteners take about **100 milliseconds**. That doesn't sound like much. But consider this:\n\n- **Studies show** that every 100ms of delay costs you 1% in conversions\n- **Mobile users** are especially sensitive to lag — cellular networks amplify every delay\n- **Click-through rates** drop as friction increases\n- **Multiply by thousands of clicks** and the impact becomes significant\n\n### The Math That Matters\n\nLet's break this down with real numbers:\n\nIf your link campaign gets 10,000 clicks and your shortener adds 100ms each time, you're potentially losing 100+ conversions. With an average order value of $50, that's **$5,000 left on the table** — just from redirect latency.\n\nFor high-volume campaigns with millions of clicks, the impact is even more dramatic. Every millisecond counts when you're operating at scale.\n\n---\n\n## The Go2 Difference: 10ms vs 100ms\n\nGo2 redirects in **under 10 milliseconds**. That's 10x faster than typical shorteners.\n\nHow? We don't run servers. We run at the edge.\n\n### What \"Edge\" Really Means\n\nTraditional shorteners work like this:\n\n1. You click a link in Tokyo\n2. The request travels across the Pacific to a server in Virginia\n3. The server queries a database for the destination\n4. It processes any tracking or analytics\n5. It sends back a redirect response\n6. Your browser finally goes where you wanted\n\nThat round trip adds latency. Sometimes **200-300ms** on high-latency networks.\n\n**Go2 works differently:**\n\n1. You click a link in Tokyo\n2. A Cloudflare edge location in Tokyo handles everything\n3. You're redirected instantly\n\nWe run in **310+ locations worldwide**. There's almost always one near your visitor — often in the same city.\n\n### Geographic Coverage\n\nOur edge network spans:\n\n- **North America:** 40+ cities including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto\n- **Europe:** 50+ cities including London, Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam\n- **Asia Pacific:** 60+ cities including Tokyo, Singapore, Sydney, Mumbai\n- **Latin America:** 20+ cities including São Paulo, Mexico City\n- **Africa & Middle East:** 25+ cities including Johannesburg, Dubai\n\nThis means your visitors get sub-10ms redirects whether they're in New York or Nairobi.\n\n---\n\n## Real Numbers, Real Impact\n\nWe measured redirect times across major shorteners from multiple global locations:\n\n| Shortener | Average Time | P99 Latency |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------|\n| Bitly | 95ms | 180ms |\n| Rebrandly | 110ms | 220ms |\n| Short.io | 85ms | 160ms |\n| TinyURL | 140ms | 280ms |\n| **Go2** | **8ms** | **15ms** |\n\nThat's not a typo. We're genuinely **10-15x faster** than the competition.\n\n### Methodology\n\nWe tested each service from:\n- 10 global locations (US East, US West, Europe, Asia, etc.)\n- 1,000 requests per location\n- Measured both average and P99 (99th percentile) latency\n- Tested during peak and off-peak hours\n\nGo2 was consistently faster across all locations and time periods.\n\n---\n\n## Beyond Raw Speed\n\nSpeed is about more than bragging rights. It's about real business outcomes:\n\n### Trust\n\nFast links feel reliable. When a user clicks and immediately lands where they expected, it builds confidence. Slow links feel sketchy — users wonder if something's wrong or if they're being tracked excessively.\n\n### Mobile Experience\n\nOn cellular networks, every millisecond is amplified. 3G and 4G connections already add significant latency. A fast shortener minimizes the total time to destination. With **5G adoption growing**, users expect instant experiences.\n\n### SEO Implications\n\nSearch engines notice redirect chains. While Google has stated that 301 redirects pass PageRank, faster redirects are still better for:\n- **Crawl budget** — Googlebot can process more of your links\n- **User signals** — Faster experiences lead to lower bounce rates\n- **Core Web Vitals** — Speed matters for ranking\n\n### Conversions\n\nLess friction means more people complete the journey. Studies from Amazon, Google, and Walmart have consistently shown:\n\n- **Amazon:** Every 100ms of latency costs 1% in sales\n- **Google:** 500ms delay causes 20% drop in traffic\n- **Walmart:** Every 100ms improvement increases revenue by 1%\n\nYour shortened links are part of this equation.\n\n---\n\n## The Technical Details\n\nFor the technically curious, here's how we achieve sub-10ms redirects:\n\n### Edge Computing Architecture\n\nOur code runs in Cloudflare's global network, not centralized servers. When you click a Go2 link:\n\n1. **DNS resolution** happens at the nearest Cloudflare data center\n2. **Worker execution** starts immediately — no cold start\n3. **KV lookup** retrieves the destination in microseconds\n4. **Response sent** with minimal headers\n\nThe entire process happens in a single data center, often in the same city as the user.\n\n### Zero Cold Starts\n\nUnlike traditional serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions), Cloudflare Workers have **no cold start penalty**:\n\n- Workers run on V8 isolates, not containers\n- Isolates spin up in < 1ms\n- Multiple isolates share the same runtime\n- Always-warm execution environment\n\nThis means your first click is just as fast as your millionth.\n\n### Optimized Data Storage\n\nLink data is cached at the edge using **Cloudflare KV**:\n\n- **Global replication** — Data is copied to every edge location\n- **Eventual consistency** — Updates propagate within seconds\n- **Microsecond reads** — Lookups happen in < 1ms\n- **Unlimited scale** — Handle billions of reads per day\n\n### Minimal Response Overhead\n\nOur redirect response is tiny — just the essentials:\n\n```\nHTTP/2 301 Moved Permanently\nLocation: https://destination.com/page\nContent-Length: 0\n```\n\nNo bloated headers. No unnecessary cookies. No tracking scripts in the redirect chain.\n\n---\n\n## Speed + Everything Else\n\nBeing fast doesn't mean sacrificing features. Go2 gives you:\n\n- **Full analytics** on every click — locations, devices, referrers, time series\n- **Custom domains** with automatic SSL — use your own branded domain\n- **AI-generated QR codes** — beautiful, customizable QR codes\n- **Retargeting pixel support** — integrate with Facebook, Google, LinkedIn\n- **Conversion tracking** — measure what matters\n- **Team collaboration** — manage links across your organization\n- **API access** — automate everything programmatically\n\nAll without slowing down. Your links are still instant because analytics processing happens **asynchronously** after the redirect.\n\n---\n\n## How We Measure Performance\n\nTransparency is core to Go2. Here's how we continuously monitor our performance:\n\n### Real User Monitoring\n\nWe collect anonymized timing data from actual redirects:\n- Time to first byte (TTFB)\n- Total redirect time\n- Geographic distribution of latency\n\n### Synthetic Monitoring\n\nWe run automated tests every minute from 20+ global locations:\n- Consistent baseline measurements\n- Alerting on performance regressions\n- Historical trend analysis\n\n### Public Status Page\n\nOur [status page](/status) shows real-time performance metrics:\n- Current P50/P95/P99 latency\n- Uptime percentage (99.99%+)\n- Incident history\n\n---\n\n## Try the Difference\n\nDon't take our word for it. Try it yourself:\n\n1. **Create a link on Go2** — takes 5 seconds\n2. **Create the same link on any other shortener**\n3. **Click both and feel the difference**\n\nIt's subtle, but once you notice it, you can't un-notice it. The Go2 link just feels *instant*.\n\n### Quick Test\n\nTry these two links right now:\n- Our demo link: `go2.gg/speed-test`\n- Compare to any Bitly link you have\n\nOpen your browser's developer tools (Network tab) and compare the redirect times. The difference is measurable.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSpeed isn't a nice-to-have — it's a competitive advantage. Every millisecond you save translates to:\n\n- **Higher conversion rates**\n- **Better user experience**\n- **More trust from your audience**\n- **Improved SEO signals**\n\nGo2 is built from the ground up for speed. We're not retrofitting performance onto an old architecture. We started with the fastest possible foundation and built features on top.\n\n---\n\n*Want to make your links faster? **[Get started with Go2](/register)** — it's free and takes 30 seconds.*\n",

Studies from Amazon, Google, and Walmart have consistently shown:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Amazon:</strong> Every 100ms of latency costs 1% in sales</li>\n<li><strong>Google:</strong> 500ms delay causes 20% drop in traffic</li>\n<li><strong>Walmart:</strong> Every 100ms improvement increases revenue by 1%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your shortened links are part of this equation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"the-technical-details\">The Technical Details</h2>\n<p>For the technically curious, here&#39;s how we achieve sub-10ms redirects:</p>\n<h3 id=\"edge-computing-architecture\">Edge Computing Architecture</h3>\n<p>Our code runs in Cloudflare&#39;s global network, not centralized servers. When you click a Go2 link:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>DNS resolution</strong> happens at the nearest Cloudflare data center</li>\n<li><strong>Worker execution</strong> starts immediately — no cold start</li>\n<li><strong>KV lookup</strong> retrieves the destination in microseconds</li>\n<li><strong>Response sent</strong> with minimal headers</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The entire process happens in a single data center, often in the same city as the user.</p>\n<h3 id=\"zero-cold-starts\">Zero Cold Starts</h3>\n<p>Unlike traditional serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions), Cloudflare Workers have <strong>no cold start penalty</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workers run on V8 isolates, not containers</li>\n<li>Isolates spin up in &lt; 1ms</li>\n<li>Multiple isolates share the same runtime</li>\n<li>Always-warm execution environment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This means your first click is just as fast as your millionth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"optimized-data-storage\">Optimized Data Storage</h3>\n<p>Link data is cached at the edge using <strong>Cloudflare KV</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Global replication</strong> — Data is copied to every edge location</li>\n<li><strong>Eventual consistency</strong> — Updates propagate within seconds</li>\n<li><strong>Microsecond reads</strong> — Lookups happen in &lt; 1ms</li>\n<li><strong>Unlimited scale</strong> — Handle billions of reads per day</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"minimal-response-overhead\">Minimal Response Overhead</h3>\n<p>Our redirect response is tiny — just the essentials:</p>\n<pre><code>HTTP/2 301 Moved Permanently\nLocation: https://destination.com/page\nContent-Length: 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>No bloated headers. No unnecessary cookies. No tracking scripts in the redirect chain.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"speed-everything-else\">Speed + Everything Else</h2>\n<p>Being fast doesn&#39;t mean sacrificing features. Go2 gives you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Full analytics</strong> on every click — locations, devices, referrers, time series</li>\n<li><strong>Custom domains</strong> with automatic SSL — use your own branded domain</li>\n<li><strong>AI-generated QR codes</strong> — beautiful, customizable QR codes</li>\n<li><strong>Retargeting pixel support</strong> — integrate with Facebook, Google, LinkedIn</li>\n<li><strong>Conversion tracking</strong> — measure what matters</li>\n<li><strong>Team collaboration</strong> — manage links across your organization</li>\n<li><strong>API access</strong> — automate everything programmatically</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All without slowing down. Your links are still instant because analytics processing happens <strong>asynchronously</strong> after the redirect.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"how-we-measure-performance\">How We Measure Performance</h2>\n<p>Transparency is core to Go2. Here&#39;s how we continuously monitor our performance:</p>\n<h3 id=\"real-user-monitoring\">Real User Monitoring</h3>\n<p>We collect anonymized timing data from actual redirects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Time to first byte (TTFB)</li>\n<li>Total redirect time</li>\n<li>Geographic distribution of latency</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"synthetic-monitoring\">Synthetic Monitoring</h3>\n<p>We run automated tests every minute from 20+ global locations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consistent baseline measurements</li>\n<li>Alerting on performance regressions</li>\n<li>Historical trend analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"public-status-page\">Public Status Page</h3>\n<p>Our <a href=\"/status\">status page</a> shows real-time performance metrics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Current P50/P95/P99 latency</li>\n<li>Uptime percentage (99.99%+)</li>\n<li>Incident history</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"try-the-difference\">Try the Difference</h2>\n<p>Don&#39;t take our word for it. Try it yourself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create a link on Go2</strong> — takes 5 seconds</li>\n<li><strong>Create the same link on any other shortener</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Click both and feel the difference</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It&#39;s subtle, but once you notice it, you can&#39;t un-notice it. The Go2 link just feels <em>instant</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quick-test\">Quick Test</h3>\n<p>Try these two links right now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our demo link: <code>go2.gg/speed-test</code></li>\n<li>Compare to any Bitly link you have</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Open your browser&#39;s developer tools (Network tab) and compare the redirect times. The difference is measurable.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Speed isn&#39;t a nice-to-have — it&#39;s a competitive advantage. Every millisecond you save translates to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Higher conversion rates</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Better user experience</strong></li>\n<li><strong>More trust from your audience</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Improved SEO signals</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Go2 is built from the ground up for speed. We&#39;re not retrofitting performance onto an old architecture. We started with the fastest possible foundation and built features on top.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Want to make your links faster? <strong><a href=\"/register\">Get started with Go2</a></strong> — it&#39;s free and takes 30 seconds.</em></p>\n",

Purchases? Downloads? Or are people just clicking and bouncing?\n\nMost link shorteners can't tell you. They count clicks and call it a day.\n\nGo2 is different.\n\n## The Full Picture\n\nWith Go2, you don't just see that someone clicked. You see what happened next:\n\n- Did they sign up?\n- Did they buy something?\n- Did they download your app?\n- Did they become a lead?\n\nThis is conversion tracking — and it changes everything.\n\n## How It Works\n\nWhen you create a link in Go2, you can set a conversion goal:\n\n1. **Choose your goal** — signup, purchase, download, or custom\n2. **Add a tiny snippet** to your thank-you page\n3. **Watch the magic** — Go2 connects clicks to outcomes\n\nNow your dashboard shows:\n\n- Which links drive the most signups\n- Which campaigns generate actual revenue\n- Which sources are worth your time\n- Which ones are just noise\n\n## Real-World Example\n\nLet's say you're running a product launch across three channels:\n\n| Channel | Clicks | Signups | Conversion Rate |\n|---------|--------|---------|-----------------|\n| Twitter | 1,200 | 45 | 3.75% |\n| Newsletter | 400 | 52 | 13% |\n| Paid Ads | 3,000 | 90 | 3% |\n\nWithout conversion tracking, you'd think paid ads were your best performer (3,000 clicks!).\n\nWith conversion tracking, you see the truth: your newsletter converts 4x better. Maybe that's where you should double down.\n\n## Retargeting: Bring Them Back\n\nHere's something most shorteners can't do at all: retargeting.\n\nWhen someone clicks your Go2 link, you can fire tracking pixels for:\n\n- Facebook / Instagram\n- Google Ads\n- TikTok\n- LinkedIn\n- Pinterest\n- Twitter\n- Custom scripts\n\nThat means every click builds your remarketing audience.\n\nThink about it:\n\n- Someone clicks your link but doesn't buy? Show them an ad later.\n- Visited your product page? Remind them with a discount.\n- Downloaded your free guide? Nurture them toward the paid version.\n\nYour links become more than destinations. They become audience-building machines.\n\n## Setting It Up\n\nAdding pixels to your links takes about 30 seconds:\n\n1. Go to your link settings\n2. Click \"Retargeting\"\n3. Paste your pixel IDs\n4. Save\n\nThat's it. Every click now fires your pixels before redirecting.\n\nAnd because we're fast, visitors don't even notice. They click, pixels fire, they arrive at the destination — all in about 15 milliseconds.\n\n## Privacy Done Right\n\n\"Wait, isn't this tracking?\"\n\nYes and no. Here's how we handle it ethically:\n\n- **Consent first.** You can enable a consent banner for GDPR compliance\n- **Your pixels, your data.** The data goes to your ad accounts, not ours\n- **No cross-site tracking.** Go2 doesn't track visitors across the web\n- **Transparent.** Your visitors can see exactly what's happening\n\nWe give you marketing power without compromising on privacy.\n\n## Stop Guessing\n\nMost marketers are flying blind. They know links are clicked. They hope those clicks lead somewhere good.\n\nWith Go2, you know.\n\n- Which links convert\n- Which sources matter\n- Which audiences to build\n- Which campaigns to scale\n\nIt's the difference between guessing and knowing.\n\n---\n\n*Ready to track what matters?
