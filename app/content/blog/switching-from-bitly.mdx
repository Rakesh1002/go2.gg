If you're using Bitly and feeling the squeeze — higher prices, limited features, slow support — you're not alone. Thousands of marketers, creators, and businesses are looking for alternatives.

The good news? Switching is easier than you think.

## Why People Are Leaving Bitly

We hear the same things over and over:

**"It's getting expensive."** Bitly's free tier is limited to 10 links per month now. Want basic analytics? That's $35/month. Need more features? You're looking at $300+/year.

**"It feels slow."** Bitly redirects take around 100ms. That might seem fast, but it's actually 10x slower than it could be.

**"Support is frustrating."** AI chatbots. Endless knowledge base articles. Good luck talking to a human.

**"The interface is cluttered."** What should be simple feels complicated. Finding what you need takes too many clicks.

## What You Get with Go2

Here's what changes when you switch:

| Feature | Bitly | Go2 |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Free links | 10/month | 25/month |
| Basic analytics | Paid ($35/mo) | Free |
| Custom domains | Paid | Free (1 included) |
| Redirect speed | ~100ms | ~10ms |
| QR codes | Basic | AI-generated designs |
| Retargeting pixels | No | Yes (all plans) |
| Conversion tracking | No | Yes |
| Open source | No | Yes |

## The One-Click Migration

We built a migration tool that makes switching painless:

1. **Connect your Bitly account** — Enter your API key and we'll fetch everything
2. **Preview your links** — See exactly what will be imported
3. **Click import** — All your links, tags, and settings come over
4. **Done** — Your links work immediately

The whole process takes about a minute. Your old Bitly links keep working (we just copy everything), so there's zero risk of broken links.

### We Also Import From

- Rebrandly
- Short.io
- TinyURL
- Dub.co

Same easy process for all of them.

## What About My Existing Links?

Great question. Here's how it works:

**Your Bitly links stay active.** We don't touch them. They'll keep working forever (or until Bitly changes something).

**New Go2 links are created.** You get fresh Go2 links with all your existing settings — custom slugs, tags, destinations.

**Gradual transition.** Update links at your own pace. Use Go2 for new campaigns while old links still work.

## The Real Difference

Beyond features and pricing, there's something more fundamental:

**We're transparent.** Go2 is open source. You can see our code, understand how it works, and even self-host if you want. No black boxes.

**We respect privacy.** No cookies tracking your visitors. No selling data. Just clean, ethical link tracking.

**We're fast.** Not "fast enough" — actually fast. 10ms redirects mean your visitors get where they're going instantly.

## Ready to Switch?

Here's how to get started:

1. [Create your free Go2 account](/register)
2. Go to Settings → Migration
3. Connect your Bitly account
4. Click "Import All"

That's it. Your links, your brand, your way — just faster, cheaper, and more transparent.
