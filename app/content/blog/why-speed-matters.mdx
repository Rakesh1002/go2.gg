"It's just a redirect. How much could speed really matter?"

We get this question a lot. And the answer might surprise you.

> **TL;DR:** Go2 redirects in under 10ms — that's 10x faster than traditional shorteners. This isn't just about bragging rights. Faster links mean higher conversions, better mobile experience, and more trust from your audience.

---

## The Invisible Tax

Every time someone clicks your shortened link, there's a delay. They wait while the shortener looks up where to send them, then redirects to the destination.

Most shorteners take about **100 milliseconds**. That doesn't sound like much. But consider this:

- **Studies show** that every 100ms of delay costs you 1% in conversions
- **Mobile users** are especially sensitive to lag — cellular networks amplify every delay
- **Click-through rates** drop as friction increases
- **Multiply by thousands of clicks** and the impact becomes significant

### The Math That Matters

Let's break this down with real numbers:

If your link campaign gets 10,000 clicks and your shortener adds 100ms each time, you're potentially losing 100+ conversions. With an average order value of $50, that's **$5,000 left on the table** — just from redirect latency.

For high-volume campaigns with millions of clicks, the impact is even more dramatic. Every millisecond counts when you're operating at scale.

## The Go2 Difference: 10ms vs 100ms

Go2 redirects in **under 10 milliseconds**. That's 10x faster than typical shorteners.

How? We don't run servers. We run at the edge.

### What "Edge" Really Means

Traditional shorteners work like this:

1. You click a link in Tokyo
2. The request travels across the Pacific to a server in Virginia
3. The server queries a database for the destination
4. It processes any tracking or analytics
5. It sends back a redirect response
6. Your browser finally goes where you wanted

That round trip adds latency. Sometimes **200-300ms** on high-latency networks.

**Go2 works differently:**

1. You click a link in Tokyo
2. A Cloudflare edge location in Tokyo handles everything
3. You're redirected instantly

We run in **310+ locations worldwide**. There's almost always one near your visitor — often in the same city.

### Geographic Coverage

Our edge network spans:

- **North America:** 40+ cities including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto
- **Europe:** 50+ cities including London, Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam
- **Asia Pacific:** 60+ cities including Tokyo, Singapore, Sydney, Mumbai
- **Latin America:** 20+ cities including São Paulo, Mexico City
- **Africa & Middle East:** 25+ cities including Johannesburg, Dubai

This means your visitors get sub-10ms redirects whether they're in New York or Nairobi.

## Real Numbers, Real Impact

We measured redirect times across major shorteners from multiple global locations:

| Shortener | Average Time | P99 Latency |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Bitly | 95ms | 180ms |
| Rebrandly | 110ms | 220ms |
| Short.io | 85ms | 160ms |
| TinyURL | 140ms | 280ms |
| **Go2** | **8ms** | **15ms** |

That's not a typo. We're genuinely **10-15x faster** than the competition.

### Methodology

We tested each service from:
- 10 global locations (US East, US West, Europe, Asia, etc.)
- 1,000 requests per location
- Measured both average and P99 (99th percentile) latency
- Tested during peak and off-peak hours

Go2 was consistently faster across all locations and time periods.

## Beyond Raw Speed

Speed is about more than bragging rights. It's about real business outcomes:

### Trust

Fast links feel reliable. When a user clicks and immediately lands where they expected, it builds confidence. Slow links feel sketchy — users wonder if something's wrong or if they're being tracked excessively.

### Mobile Experience

On cellular networks, every millisecond is amplified. 3G and 4G connections already add significant latency. A fast shortener minimizes the total time to destination. With **5G adoption growing**, users expect instant experiences.

### SEO Implications

Search engines notice redirect chains. While Google has stated that 301 redirects pass PageRank, faster redirects are still better for:
- **Crawl budget** — Googlebot can process more of your links
- **User signals** — Faster experiences lead to lower bounce rates
- **Core Web Vitals** — Speed matters for ranking

### Conversions

Less friction means more people complete the journey. Studies from Amazon, Google, and Walmart have consistently shown:

- **Amazon:** Every 100ms of latency costs 1% in sales
- **Google:** 500ms delay causes 20% drop in traffic
- **Walmart:** Every 100ms improvement increases revenue by 1%

Your shortened links are part of this equation.

## The Technical Details

For the technically curious, here's how we achieve sub-10ms redirects:

### Edge Computing Architecture

Our code runs in Cloudflare's global network, not centralized servers. When you click a Go2 link:

1. **DNS resolution** happens at the nearest Cloudflare data center
2. **Worker execution** starts immediately — no cold start
3. **KV lookup** retrieves the destination in microseconds
4. **Response sent** with minimal headers

The entire process happens in a single data center, often in the same city as the user.

### Zero Cold Starts

Unlike traditional serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions), Cloudflare Workers have **no cold start penalty**:

- Workers run on V8 isolates, not containers
- Isolates spin up in < 1ms
- Multiple isolates share the same runtime
- Always-warm execution environment

This means your first click is just as fast as your millionth.

### Optimized Data Storage

Link data is cached at the edge using **Cloudflare KV**:

- **Global replication** — Data is copied to every edge location
- **Eventual consistency** — Updates propagate within seconds
- **Microsecond reads** — Lookups happen in < 1ms
- **Unlimited scale** — Handle billions of reads per day

### Minimal Response Overhead

Our redirect response is tiny — just the essentials:

```
HTTP/2 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://destination.com/page
Content-Length: 0
```

No bloated headers. No unnecessary cookies. No tracking scripts in the redirect chain.

## Speed + Everything Else

Being fast doesn't mean sacrificing features. Go2 gives you:

- **Full analytics** on every click — locations, devices, referrers, time series
- **Custom domains** with automatic SSL — use your own branded domain
- **AI-generated QR codes** — beautiful, customizable QR codes
- **Retargeting pixel support** — integrate with Facebook, Google, LinkedIn
- **Conversion tracking** — measure what matters
- **Team collaboration** — manage links across your organization
- **API access** — automate everything programmatically

All without slowing down. Your links are still instant because analytics processing happens **asynchronously** after the redirect.

## How We Measure Performance

Transparency is core to Go2. Here's how we continuously monitor our performance:

### Real User Monitoring

We collect anonymized timing data from actual redirects:
- Time to first byte (TTFB)
- Total redirect time
- Geographic distribution of latency

### Synthetic Monitoring

We run automated tests every minute from 20+ global locations:
- Consistent baseline measurements
- Alerting on performance regressions
- Historical trend analysis

### Public Status Page

Our [status page](/status) shows real-time performance metrics:
- Current P50/P95/P99 latency
- Uptime percentage (99.99%+)
- Incident history

## Try the Difference

Don't take our word for it. Try it yourself:

1. **Create a link on Go2** — takes 5 seconds
2. **Create the same link on any other shortener**
3. **Click both and feel the difference**

It's subtle, but once you notice it, you can't un-notice it. The Go2 link just feels *instant*.

### Quick Test

Try these two links right now:
- Our demo link: `go2.gg/speed-test`
- Compare to any Bitly link you have

Open your browser's developer tools (Network tab) and compare the redirect times. The difference is measurable.

## Conclusion

Speed isn't a nice-to-have — it's a competitive advantage. Every millisecond you save translates to:

- **Higher conversion rates**
- **Better user experience**
- **More trust from your audience**
- **Improved SEO signals**

Go2 is built from the ground up for speed. We're not retrofitting performance onto an old architecture. We started with the fastest possible foundation and built features on top.
