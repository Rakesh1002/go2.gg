You just launched a campaign. Links are getting clicked. The numbers are going up.

But here's the question that matters: **are those clicks turning into anything?**

Signups? Purchases? Downloads? Or are people just clicking and bouncing?

Most link shorteners can't tell you. They count clicks and call it a day.

Go2 is different.

## The Full Picture

With Go2, you don't just see that someone clicked. You see what happened next:

- Did they sign up?
- Did they buy something?
- Did they download your app?
- Did they become a lead?

This is conversion tracking — and it changes everything.

## How It Works

When you create a link in Go2, you can set a conversion goal:

1. **Choose your goal** — signup, purchase, download, or custom
2. **Add a tiny snippet** to your thank-you page
3. **Watch the magic** — Go2 connects clicks to outcomes

Now your dashboard shows:

- Which links drive the most signups
- Which campaigns generate actual revenue
- Which sources are worth your time
- Which ones are just noise

## Real-World Example

Let's say you're running a product launch across three channels:

| Channel | Clicks | Signups | Conversion Rate |
|---------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Twitter | 1,200 | 45 | 3.75% |
| Newsletter | 400 | 52 | 13% |
| Paid Ads | 3,000 | 90 | 3% |

Without conversion tracking, you'd think paid ads were your best performer (3,000 clicks!).

With conversion tracking, you see the truth: your newsletter converts 4x better. Maybe that's where you should double down.

## Retargeting: Bring Them Back

Here's something most shorteners can't do at all: retargeting.

When someone clicks your Go2 link, you can fire tracking pixels for:

- Facebook / Instagram
- Google Ads
- TikTok
- LinkedIn
- Pinterest
- Twitter
- Custom scripts

That means every click builds your remarketing audience.

Think about it:

- Someone clicks your link but doesn't buy? Show them an ad later.
- Visited your product page? Remind them with a discount.
- Downloaded your free guide? Nurture them toward the paid version.

Your links become more than destinations. They become audience-building machines.

## Setting It Up

Adding pixels to your links takes about 30 seconds:

1. Go to your link settings
2. Click "Retargeting"
3. Paste your pixel IDs
4. Save

That's it. Every click now fires your pixels before redirecting.

And because we're fast, visitors don't even notice. They click, pixels fire, they arrive at the destination — all in about 15 milliseconds.

## Privacy Done Right

"Wait, isn't this tracking?"

Yes and no. Here's how we handle it ethically:

- **Consent first.** You can enable a consent banner for GDPR compliance
- **Your pixels, your data.** The data goes to your ad accounts, not ours
- **No cross-site tracking.** Go2 doesn't track visitors across the web
- **Transparent.** Your visitors can see exactly what's happening

We give you marketing power without compromising on privacy.

## Stop Guessing

Most marketers are flying blind. They know links are clicked. They hope those clicks lead somewhere good.

With Go2, you know.

- Which links convert
- Which sources matter
- Which audiences to build
- Which campaigns to scale

It's the difference between guessing and knowing.
