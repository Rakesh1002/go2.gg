description: Learn how to authenticate with the Go2 API using API keys.
---

The Go2 API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [dashboard](/dashboard/api-keys).

## API Keys

Your API key carries many privileges, so be sure to keep it secure. Don't share your API key in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, or public repositories.

### Creating an API Key

1. Go to [Dashboard > API Keys](/dashboard/api-keys)
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Give your key a descriptive name
4. Copy the key immediately - you won't be able to see it again

### Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all requests:

```bash
curl https://api.go2.gg/api/v1/links \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer go2_your_api_key_here"
```

### API Key Format

Go2 API keys follow this format:

```
go2_[random_characters]
```

The `go2_` prefix makes it easy to identify Go2 API keys in your code.

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate limited based on your plan:

| Plan | Requests per minute |
|------|---------------------|
| Free | 60 |
| Pro | 300 |
| Business | 1000 |
| Enterprise | Custom |

Rate limit headers are included in every response:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 59
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1704067200
```

## Error Responses

Authentication errors return a `401 Unauthorized` status:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
    "message": "Invalid or expired API key"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use environment variables** - Never hardcode API keys in your code
2. **Rotate keys regularly** - Create new keys periodically and revoke old ones
3. **Use separate keys** - Use different keys for development and production
4. **Monitor usage** - Check your API key usage in the dashboard
