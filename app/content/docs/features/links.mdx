Go2 makes it easy to create short, memorable links that redirect to any URL. This guide covers all the features available for link management.

## Creating Links

### From the Dashboard

1. Log in to your Go2 dashboard
2. Click **"Create New Link"** or press `Ctrl/Cmd + K`
3. Paste your destination URL
4. (Optional) Customize the settings
5. Click **"Create"**

### From the API

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.go2.gg/api/v1/links \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"destinationUrl": "https://example.com/my-page"}'
```

## Custom Slugs

By default, Go2 generates a random 6-character slug. You can specify a custom slug:

- **Length**: 1-50 characters
- **Characters**: Letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphens (-), underscores (_)
- **Case-sensitive**: `MyLink` and `mylink` are different slugs

### Reserved Slugs

Some slugs are reserved for system use:

- `api`, `app`, `admin`, `dashboard`
- `login`, `register`, `logout`
- `health`, `status`, `ping`

## Link Settings

### Title & Description

Add a title and description to organize your links. These are visible in your dashboard and help with searching.

### Tags

Apply tags to categorize links:

```json
{
  "tags": ["marketing", "summer-2024", "social"]
}
```

Filter links by tag in the dashboard or API.

### Expiration

Set an expiration date after which the link will stop redirecting:

```json
{
  "expiresAt": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}
```

Expired links return a 410 Gone response.

### Click Limits

Limit how many times a link can be clicked:

```json
{
  "clickLimit": 1000
}
```

Once the limit is reached, the link returns a 410 Gone response.

### Password Protection

Protect links with a password. Visitors will see a password prompt before being redirected:

```json
{
  "password": "secretcode123"
}
```

Passwords are hashed and never stored in plain text.

## UTM Parameters

Automatically append UTM parameters to your destination URLs:

```json
{
  "utmSource": "twitter",
  "utmMedium": "social",
  "utmCampaign": "summer-sale"
}
```

This transforms:
- Input: `https://example.com/page`
- Output: `https://example.com/page?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=summer-sale`

## Geo Targeting

Redirect visitors to different URLs based on their country:

```json
{
  "destinationUrl": "https://example.com/global",
  "geoTargets": {
    "US": "https://example.com/us",
    "GB": "https://example.com/uk",
    "DE": "https://example.com/de",
    "FR": "https://example.com/fr"
  }
}
```

Visitors from unlisted countries go to the default destination URL.

## Device Targeting

Redirect based on device type:

```json
{
  "destinationUrl": "https://example.com",
  "deviceTargets": {
    "mobile": "https://m.example.com",
    "tablet": "https://tablet.example.com"
  }
}
```

### App Deep Links

For mobile apps, set platform-specific deep links:

```json
{
  "destinationUrl": "https://example.com/app",
  "iosUrl": "myapp://product/123",
  "androidUrl": "intent://product/123#Intent;scheme=myapp;package=com.myapp;end"
}
```

Go2 detects the operating system and redirects accordingly.

## Link Preview Customization

Customize how your link appears when shared on social media:

```json
{
  "ogTitle": "Check out this amazing product!",
  "ogDescription": "The best product you'll ever find.",
  "ogImage": "https://example.com/og-image.png"
}
```

These settings control the Open Graph meta tags on the link preview page.

## Bulk Operations

### Bulk Create

Create multiple links at once via the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.go2.gg/api/v1/links/bulk \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "links": [
      {"destinationUrl": "https://example.com/page1"},
      {"destinationUrl": "https://example.com/page2"},
      {"destinationUrl": "https://example.com/page3"}
    ]
  }'
```

### Bulk Delete

Archive multiple links:

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.go2.gg/api/v1/links/bulk \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ids": ["lnk_abc123", "lnk_def456"]}'
```

## Link Analytics

Every link automatically tracks:

- **Total clicks** and unique visitors
- **Geographic distribution** by country and city
- **Device types** (mobile, desktop, tablet)
- **Browsers** and operating systems
- **Referrer sources**
- **Click timeline**

View analytics in the dashboard or via the API.

## Archiving vs Deleting

- **Archive**: Soft delete. Link stops redirecting but data is preserved. Can be restored.
- **Delete**: Permanent removal. Cannot be undone.

From the dashboard, you can toggle archived links visibility.

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive slugs**: `summer-sale` is better than `abc123`
2. **Set expiration dates**: Clean up old campaign links
3. **Apply tags**: Makes filtering and organization easier
4. **Monitor analytics**: Track what's working
5. **Use custom domains**: Builds brand trust
