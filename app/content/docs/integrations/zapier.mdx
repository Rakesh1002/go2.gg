For more advanced automation, use Go2 webhooks with Zapier's Webhooks by Zapier:

1. Set up a webhook in Go2 dashboard
2. Use Zapier's "Catch Hook" trigger
3. Process webhook payload in your Zap

**Example Webhook Payload**:

```json
{
  "event": "click",
  "link": {
    "id": "lnk_abc123",
    "shortUrl": "https://go2.gg/summer-sale",
    "destinationUrl": "https://example.com/product"
  },
  "click": {
    "country": "US",
    "device": "mobile",
    "referrer": "twitter.com",
    "timestamp": "2024-06-15T14:22:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Use Filters**: Add filters to avoid processing unwanted links
2. **Batch Operations**: Use Zapier's built-in delays for bulk operations
3. **Error Handling**: Set up error notifications for failed Zaps
4. **Testing**: Always test your Zaps with sample data first
5. **Rate Limits**: Be aware of Zapier's rate limits (varies by plan)
