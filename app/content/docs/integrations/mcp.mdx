description: Connect Go2 to Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI assistants using MCP.
---

The Go2 MCP (Model Context Protocol) server enables AI assistants like Claude to manage your short links through natural language.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that allows AI assistants to connect to external tools and services. With the Go2 MCP server, you can:

- Create short links by describing what you want
- Get analytics summaries in plain language
- Manage links without leaving your AI chat

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @go2/mcp-server
```

Or use npx without installing:

```bash
npx @go2/mcp-server --api-key go2_xxx
```

## Setup with Claude Desktop

1. Get your API key from [Dashboard → API Keys](/dashboard/api-keys)

2. Edit your Claude Desktop config file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "go2": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@go2/mcp-server", "--api-key", "go2_xxx"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude Desktop

4. You should now see "Go2" in Claude's available tools

## Available Commands

Once connected, you can ask Claude to:

### Create Links

> "Create a short link for https://example.com/my-long-article-about-something-interesting"

Claude will create the link and return the short URL.

### Get Analytics

> "How many clicks did my 'summer-sale' link get this week?"

> "Show me my top performing links"

### Manage Links

> "Update my 'promo' link to point to the new landing page"

> "Archive all links older than 30 days"

### Bulk Operations

> "Create short links for these 5 URLs: [list of URLs]"

## Environment Variables

Instead of passing the API key as an argument, you can set environment variables:

```bash
export GO2_API_KEY=go2_xxx
export GO2_API_URL=https://api.go2.gg  # optional
```

Then run without arguments:

```bash
npx @go2/mcp-server
```

## Available Tools

The MCP server exposes these tools to AI assistants:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_link` | Create a new short link |
| `list_links` | List existing links with filtering |
| `get_link` | Get details of a specific link |
| `update_link` | Update a link's properties |
| `delete_link` | Delete a link |
| `get_analytics` | Get analytics for a link |
| `bulk_create_links` | Create multiple links at once |

## Security

- Your API key is stored locally in the Claude Desktop config
- All communication uses HTTPS
- The MCP server has read/write access based on your API key permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Claude doesn't show Go2 tools

1. Verify your config file syntax is valid JSON
2. Restart Claude Desktop completely
3. Check the Claude logs for error messages

### Authentication errors

1. Verify your API key is correct
2. Check the key hasn't expired
3. Ensure the key has the required permissions

### Rate limiting

If you're hitting rate limits, consider:
- Upgrading your plan for higher limits
- Batching operations where possible
- Adding delays between bulk operations
