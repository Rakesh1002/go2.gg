This guide will help you get started with Go2, whether you're using the web dashboard or the API.

## Option 1: Web Dashboard (No Code)

The fastest way to get started is through our web dashboard.

### Step 1: Create an Account

1. Go to [go2.gg/register](/register)
2. Sign up with your email or OAuth provider
3. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Create Your First Link

1. From the dashboard, click **"Create New Link"**
2. Paste your destination URL
3. (Optional) Customize the slug, add expiration, or set a password
4. Click **"Create"**

Your short link is ready! Share it anywhere.

### Step 3: Track Performance

Click on any link in your dashboard to see:

- Total clicks and unique visitors
- Geographic distribution
- Device and browser breakdown
- Referrer sources
- Click history over time

## Option 2: API Integration

For developers who want programmatic access, Go2 provides a full REST API.

### Step 1: Get Your API Key

1. Go to **Dashboard → Settings → API Keys**
2. Click **"Create New API Key"**
3. Copy your key (it won't be shown again)

### Step 2: Create a Link via API

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.go2.gg/api/v1/links \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "destinationUrl": "https://example.com/my-long-url",
    "slug": "my-link"
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "abc123",
    "shortUrl": "https://go2.gg/my-link",
    "destinationUrl": "https://example.com/my-long-url",
    "slug": "my-link",
    "clickCount": 0,
    "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Retrieve Link Analytics

```bash
curl https://api.go2.gg/api/v1/links/abc123/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Option 3: Public Link Creation (No Auth)

For quick links without signing up, you can use our public endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.go2.gg/api/v1/public/links \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "destinationUrl": "https://example.com/my-long-url"
  }'
```

Note: Public links have limited features and are rate-limited.
